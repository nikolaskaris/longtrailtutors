                For standardized exams, success can be as much about understanding
                the test as about finding the right answer. Long Trail Tutors works
                with families to help select standardized exams most suited to
                students' skills and abilities. We then train our students to
                think like the tests they are taking. Our strategies enable them
                to approach each section of their exams with confidence, to
                unravel questions deliberately, and to select the best answers
                efficiently.

              Founder: <span style="color: #f78c58">Nik Laskaris</span><br>
              <p>
                Nik grew up in the Mad River Valley, graduating from Harwood Union
                High School in 2011. While in high school, he taught himself to take
                the SAT and the SAT II subject tests and five years later graduated
                from Yale University, with distinction in his major. Prior to
                founding Long Trail Tutors, Nik spent three years at Yale working
                as a Science and Quantitative Reasoning tutor at the Yale Center
                for Teaching and Learning, focusing primarily on Calculus and
                First-Order Logic.

              <span style="color: #f78c58">Lindsay Kingston</span><br>
              <p>
                Lindsay grew up in the Champlain Valley, graduating from CVU in 2010. During
                the college application process she taught herself the SAT and the SAT II
                subject test for biology. She then attended Middlebury College, playing 
                varsity soccer all four years and graduating cum laude with a degree in Environmental
                Biology in 2014. After working for two years at the Brigham and Women's Hospital
                as a medical assistant, she moved home to VT to finish coursework for medical school.

              <span style="color: #f78c58">Emily Vicks</span><br>
              <p>
                Emily is from Clinton, New York, but likes to think of herself as a Vermont local. Emily taught herself the SAT for college admissions and self-studied for the MCAT last summer. She graduated from Middlebury College this past February summa cumme laude, Phi Beta Kappa, with a degree in neuroscience. After graduation, she moved to Burlington and never wants to leave. She is currently applying to medical school and will soon take on a position in clinical research at UVM and as a ski patroller at Stowe.
